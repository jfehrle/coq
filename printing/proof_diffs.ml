Displays the differences between successive proof steps in coqtop and CoqIDE.
Proof General requires minor changes to make the diffs visible, but this code
shouldn't break the existing version of PG.  See pp_diff.ml for details on how
the diff works.

Diffs are computed for the hypotheses and conclusion of the first goal between
the old and new proofs.

Diffs can be enabled with the Coq commmand "Set Diffs on|off|removed." or
"-diffs on|off|removed" on the OS command line.  The "on" option shows only the
new item with added text, while "removed" shows each modified item twice--once
with the old value showing removed text and once with the new value showing
added text.

In CoqIDE, colors and highlights can be set in the Edit/Preferences/Tags panel.
For coqtop, these can be set through the COQ_COLORS environment variable.

Limitations/Possible enhancements:

- If you go back to a prior proof step, diffs are not shown on the new current
step.  Diffs will be shown again once you do another proof step.

- Diffs are done between the first active goal in the old and new proofs.
If, for example, the proof step completed a goal, then the new goal is a
different goal, not a transformation of the old goal, so a diff is probably
not appropriate.  (There's currently no way to tell when this happens or to
accurately match goals across old and new proofs.
See https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/7653)  This is also why only the
first goal is diffed.

- "Set Diffs xx." should reprint the current goal using the new option.

- coqtop colors were chosen for white text on a black background.  They're
not the greatest.  I didn't want to change the existing green highlight.
Suggestions welcome.

- coqtop underlines removed text because (per Wikipedia) the ANSI escape code
for strikeout is not commonly supported (it didn't work on mine).  CoqIDE
uses strikeout on removed text.
